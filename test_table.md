|LLMS are currently "summoned and tame"|- The problem is that with with these experiments uh they are producing uncontrollable Minds uh the yeah that's why I call it someone and tame uh Paradigm of AI - You summoned this mind uh from the Mind space using your data and a lot of compute a lot of money and then you try to tame it using things reinforcement learning from Human feedback |                |Jaan Tallin                                  |https://youtu.be/Dmh6ciu24v0?t=2993                                                            |Yes                           |
|LLMs Dev should be required to by "insurance" for potential damages|- I would combine this with some sort of required liabilityinsurance that would even strengthen it such that the bigger the damages and the more they have to make sure somebody some insurance company is set up to pay for it and that would also discourage them in the sense that it would be harder to arrange for that insurance and the insurers would say you know you know show me that you're not going too close to this problematic part and they have problem doing that and that's why they would stay away that's the idea|                |Robin Hanson                                 |https://youtu.be/Dmh6ciu24v0?t=2999                                                            |No                            |
|Future LLMs might be smarter then Human Level, but that does not pose a specific risk|-  I'm granting that GPT 5 could be superhuman on many performance characteristics what I'm doubting is that that destroys the world.|                |Robin Hanson                                 |https://youtu.be/Dmh6ciu24v0?t=3370                                                            |No                            |
|If people were doing bad thinags, then I would look into stopping it|- if people were trying to make the worst case systems and like the management and funding of a particular you know most advanced projects were trying to make the worst case scenarios they went out of their way to make those scenarios well then I get a lot more worried about those|- Wow. - People are trying to use GPTs to be bad things already - They wouldn't "broadcast" it if they were, as it would undoughtedly be illegal|Robin Hanson                                 |https://youtu.be/Dmh6ciu24v0?t=3483                                                            |No                            |
|AI research better than better than Humans|- if we are talking about things that is able to do AI research better than better than humans uh then of course that would be um potentially manifested by the fact that we're dead |                |Jaan Tallin                                  |https://youtu.be/Dmh6ciu24v0?t=4614                                                            |Yes                           |
|AI and LLMs are already being developed with help from AI|- the thing that I would be tracking is like how much uh in every successful every successive generation how much effort was kind of put in input by uh humans on how much was AI because it's already non-zero by AI when it comes to like designing the chips and architectures there's one more topic I want to hit on|                |Jaan Tallin                                  |https://youtu.be/Dmh6ciu24v0?t=4713                                                            |Yes                           |
|          |- researchers actually do not know how to reliably uh Point uh this black box to like any gold|                |Jaan Tallin, Eliezer Yudkowsky               |                                                                                               |                              |
|AI Could Turn the world into an RPG to help Humans?|- in an MMO RPG, the mission goal for how to win is listed at the top of the screen. AI could do that for Humans. Do we want that?|                |George Hotz                                  |https://youtu.be/WS5wGal3ukw?si=Mx3mqIRVvRx0-cpv                                               |                              |

|          |- it won't be dramatic. we'll just get more and more confused about what is real on the Internet. no one will know what's happening. and we all fall over dead one day and we won't know why |                |Conor Leahy                                  |                                                                                               |Yes                           |
|Natural Selection favors AIs|- Natural Selection favors AIs or Human and this could lead to Human extinction. |                |Dan Hendrycks                                |https://twitter.com/DanHendrycks/status/1651741353574019074  https://youtu.be/Fk7cMD44uWs?t=238|Yes                           |
|Squiggle Maximizer (formerly "Paperclip maximizer")|- it would undergo an intelligence explosion: It would work to improve its own intelligence, where "intelligence" is understood in the sense of optimization power, the ability to maximize a reward/utility functionâ€”in this case, the number of paperclips. The AGI would improve its intelligence, not because it values more intelligence in its own right, but because more intelligence would help it achieve its goal of accumulating paperclips. Having increased its intelligence, it would produce more paperclips, and also use its enhanced abilities to further self-improve. Continuing this process, it would undergo an intelligence explosion and reach far-above-human levels.|                |Eliezer Yudkowsky                            |https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/squiggle-maximizer-formerly-paperclip-maximizer                  |Yes                           |
|The market will exhibit caution|- the market will exhibit caution.  every organism company consumer is acting out of self-interest and they won't assign Capital to things that have negative utility to them|- "the problem is with the market is like you know there's not always perfect information there's manipulation there's  a bad faith actors that mess with the system it's not it's not always a um rational and honest system". -- Lex Friedman|Guillaume Verdon                             |https://youtu.be/Fk7cMD44uWs?t=413                                                             |No                            |

|Train up a Human Level AI and ask it how to align a SuperAGI|- Plan of how we want to approach the problem that involves training uh roughly human level alignment researcher that can work automatically and then ask that automated alignment researcher and to figure out how to align super intelligence   -- Jan Leike https://youtu.be/Uk6-Rw5N_Dg?t=120 |- How good is it is the model as like spinning really clear and lies or like being deceptive of like pretending to do something or believe one thing and then actually wanting another I think another like really key capability here is self-exfiltration so how good would the model be like breaking the security precautions and like accessing its own weights and trying to copy it somewhere else on the internet um or persuading engineer with access to the weights to you know like download them and send them somewhere      -- Jan Leike https://youtu.be/Uk6-Rw5N_Dg?t=517 |Jan Leike                                    |https://youtu.be/Uk6-Rw5N_Dg?t=120                                                             |No                            |
